# hamter.
Hamter is a follower scraper that helps you view mutual followers and identify your fans. It uses web scraping techniques via a ChromeDriver and selenium to gather follower data and present it in an easy-to-understand interface. The app requires the Hamter icon, a Hamter GIF, selenium and ChromeDriver to function properly.

This app was made as a fun and educational project by Pantelis Zarakis. Im still learning programming so the app might be a bit unstable.
